FAVICON INSTRUCTIONS

To add your favicon:

1. Rename your image file to "favicon.png"
2. Make sure it's a proper PNG image file (not a renamed file with a different format)
3. Place it in this directory (the /public folder)
4. Make sure the file size is reasonable (preferably under 200KB)
5. The recommended dimensions are 32x32 pixels or 16x16 pixels

Once you've added a proper PNG image file, the browser tab should display your icon.

Alternatively, you can use an online favicon generator like:
